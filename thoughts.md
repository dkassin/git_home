1. We will be collaborating and working in live teams a lot to practice.
2. We will be learning from both our mod 1 prework and the mod 0 live lessons collaboratively.
3. I would like to get farther along in my mod 1 prework before the next few classes so I feel as if its more review as opposed to new material.
4. I'd like to spend time reviewing the group slack channel as a way to review, by seeing the different questions my peers post.
5. I'd like to shout out my girlfriend Kathy for being very supportive while i both work and doing turing prework.
6. This is great practice
7. I wonder how many thoughts i can add during mod 0.
